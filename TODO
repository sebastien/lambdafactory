Design
======

 - Every element should have an associated dataflow, which could be the element
   own dataflow (blocks, functions, classes, modules) or a dataflow inherited
   from a parent (computation, assignation, etc)

Core modules:
=============

	Core functions/predicates

		- like
		- isa
		- isinstance
		 
	Conversion:

		- describe
		- string
		- list
		- tuple
	
	Manipulation/Introspection:

		- getSlot
		- hasSlot
		- setSlot
		- keysOf
		- slotsOf
		- methodsOf
		- propertiesOf
		- operationsOf
		- sharedOf
		- classOf
		- typeOf
	
	Functional arithmetic operators:

		- add
		- mul
		- div
		- mod
		- sub
		- ceil
		- floor
		- round
		- random
		- sin
		- cos
		- PI
	
	Functional programming:

		- car
		- cdr
		- map
		- filter
		- reduce
		- fold

Checks
======

 - Class should have a constructor
 - Parent class not resolved
 - Function/method redefined
