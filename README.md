位-factory, a language development kit
=====================================

位-factory provides a factory-based API to create abstract models of programs
and compile them to a target language (Python and JavaScript are currently
supported).

位-factory features an abstract OO representation of programs that fits
dynamically-typed languages. 

位-factory is written both in Python and [Sugar](https://github.com/sebastien/sugar2),
and comes pre-compiled as a ready-to-load Python library.

Installing
==========

pip install --user lambdafactory
