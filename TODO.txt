Design
======

 - Every element should have an associated dataflow, which could be the element
   own dataflow (blocks, functions, classes, modules) or a dataflow inherited
   from a parent (computation, assignation, etc)

Checks
======

 - Class should have a constructor
 - Parent class not resolved
 - Function/method redefined
