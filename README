== LambdaFactory
== Custom Language Development Kit

LambdaFactory provides a factory-based (as in design patterns) API to create
every element that makes a program, from the simple computations to the
OO and functional constructs.

LambdaFactory support front-end and back-end plugins. Front-end plugins are
parsers that parse a specific language and generate a LambdaFactory program
model. Back-end plugins are plugins that translate the LambdaFactory program
model to a specific language.

LambdaFactory comes with the following backends:

  - JavaScript
  - ActionScript 3.0
  - Python
